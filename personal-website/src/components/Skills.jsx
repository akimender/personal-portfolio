                    <p>
                        I have developed a strong technical skill set through a combination of academic coursework, personal projects, and hands-on experience in software engineering and machine learning. My proficiency in Python, Java, and JavaScript comes from building full-stack applications for my personal projects where I use tools like React, Django, and Flask to create seamless user experiences. Additionally, I have experience deploying applications using AWS and Docker, optimizing performance and scalability. Through these experiences, Iâ€™ve honed my ability to design efficient systems, analyze complex problems, and build solutions that are both scalable and impactful.
